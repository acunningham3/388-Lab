% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The automated greenhouse plant management system will be able to acquire a multitude of inputs from the surrounding environment and respond to them with the correct course of action in a timely manner. To fully understand the extent as to how the product should function, it is important to provide details as to how the average greenhouse works to properly shelter plants for successful growth and development. When the temperature in a greenhouse gets too high for the plants, typically a window is opened to cool the room down. For the automated greenhouse system, an exhaust fan will be implemented to go off when the temperature is sensed to be too high or humid. On the contrary, when the temperature is sensed to be too cold, a heat system must be implemented in a greenhouse to prevent the plants from getting frigid. For the product, a heater will be placed on the wall of the greenhouse that will be activated when temperature is sensed to be too cold. Furthermore, lighting is an essential part to plant life in a greenhouse environment. Without proper lighting, plants will wither up and perish. This product will function by providing light to the plants the same way many large-scale real life greenhouses do: through use of LEDs. When it is sensed that it is too dark in the greenhouse, the product will turn on an LED strip that will be located along the ceiling of the greenhouse. This of course will include cloudy days when there is not enough sun, as well as when it is night time and dark outside. Another important aspect to counter in is whether or not a plant has enough water it its soil. In a typical greenhouse, many gardeners will just manually water the plants. With the product, however, user labor is not required, so there must be an irrigation system implemented This will consist of soil moister sensors for the plants under test, where when moisture is sensed to be too low, a pump is used to send water directly into the plant's pot. Once the sensor indicates that a sufficient moisture level has been met, the pump will cease all water movement. The use of an irrigation system of course requires a water source, which must also be monitored. This will be done with use of a float switch. When the water is at a high enough level, the switch is closed, whereas when the water level is too low, the switch is opened. It will be implemented that if the plants require water, but the water level is too low, the pump will not run, as this would just be a waste of power. Much more specific details as to how the equipment discussed functions as well as how it works can be seen in the Methods and Procedures section. 

\textbf{System 1 under test:} \\
The first system under test was constructed in order to verify that the float switch worked correctly. There will be one float switch that will monitor the water level in the water chamber. Since it is a switch, when the water in the chamber is at or above it, full contact is made. When the water falls below it, however, the switch will no longer be closed and the circuit will be open. As a result, no current will flow and the micro-controller will be notified and respond by disabling the water pump. In order to ensure that the float switch functioned properly, the following test was constructed and executed. \\

\noindent{\textbf{System 1 Test Setup:} 
The float switch was tested using the following components:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Float Switch (RSF83Y)
\item 5 V power supply (from Arduino Uno R3 micro-controller)
\item LED (light emitting diode)
\item 2k Ohm Resistor
\item 4 Wires
\end{itemize}
\textbf{System 1 Test Procedure:}
The test was performed by first connecting each of the two copper wires from the float switch to two separate wires. This was done because the copper wires could not fit into the bread board on their own. Next, 5 volts was supplied from the Arduino Uno and connected to one of the wires from the float switch. Then, the other wire from the float switch was connected to a 2k Ohm resistor. The resistor was then connected to the positive terminal of the LED and the negative terminal was connected to ground. Once the circuit was completed, the float switch was closed and the LED lit up. Next the LED was closed and the LED turned off. \\
\\
\textbf{System 2 Under Test:} The second system under test was constructed in order confirm that the photoresistor worked properly. The photoresistor will be used to monitor the amount of sunlight inside of the green house. When light is present, the resistor has a lower resistance and as the light decreases, the resistance increases. The the voltage will change as a result of the resistance increasing or decreasing  due to Ohms's Law and the micro-controller will monitor these changes and enable LEDS when there isn't enough sunlight present. The following test was orchestrated in order to ensure that the photoresistor was functioning properly. (See appendix for pictures of the test conducted)\\


\noindent{\textbf{System 2 Test Setup: }} The photoresistor was tested using the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item Photoresistor
\item 5 V power supply (from Arduino Uno R3 micro-controller)
\item LED(light emitting diode)
\item 2 Wires
\end{itemize}

\textbf{System 2 Test Procedure:} The test was performed by first connecting 5 volts from the Arduino Uno to the photoresistor. Next, the photoresistor was connected to the positive terminal of the LED. The negative terminal of the LED was then connected to ground. Once the circuit was completed, a finger was used to cover the top of the photoresistor. When this happened, the LED dimmed because the resistance increased. Next the photoresitor was uncovered and the birghtness of the LED increased. (See appendix for pictures of the test conducted)
\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:} \\
This next testing session tests the reliability and integrity of the supplied humidity and temperature sensor. The given sensor, or the DHT22, has the ability to detect the percentage of humidity and the temperature of the air around it. This test is to ensure that the implementation created in the Arduino IDE works correctly and creates logically outputs. As well as to test the functionality of the device.\\

\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:}
The DHT22 was tested using the following components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT22)
    \item Arduino Uno R3 Micro-Controller
    \item 10k Ohm Resistor
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{System 3 Test Procedure:} \\
The DHT22 was thoroughly tested using a breadboard and an Arduino UNO R3 to provide 5 volts to in the VCC pin. The second PWM pin is connected to the data line of the DHT22. Ground is connected to ground. A pinout for the DHT22 can be found in the Appendix. Below is the a section of the code implementation for the testing.

This code loads the incoming humidity and temperature readings to two different variables, h and f. The code iterates this loop every 1 second for a reliable output of readings. The output monitor for this section can be found in the Laboratory Experimental Results.

% Laboratory experimental results
\section{Laboratory Experimental Results}

The first image depicting the work completed thus far can be found in the appendices section and is labeled figure 2. This is the prototype flow chart for the product, showing what sensors and switches will be used, how they will be processed, and what they will activate as a response. It can be seen through the dots in the CPU that the temperature and humidity is related, as they are sensed on the same hardware, but different results will occur depending on the situation. Too hot or humid will result in the fan being activated, while too cold with result in the heater being turned on. The soil moister and the water level are also connected, as they will result in the irrigation system being implemented. Finally, the light sensor will result in activating the LEDs.
