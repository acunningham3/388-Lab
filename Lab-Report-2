\tab The Abstract should be indented an additional half an inch on both sides of the paragraph from the margins, and should be at the top of the first page after the table on contents, and before the introduction. 

The abstract is typically one paragraph (200- words) that summarizes the purpose of the report, the methods employed, the key findings, and the significance or major conclusions. This section should include concise statements and contain specific information. 
\end{abstract}

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The introduction should include the purpose (what was tested), problem (why was the experiment conducted), and scope (what was analyzed) of the report. In addition, introductions can sometimes include justification of the experiment’s importance. It can also refer to relevant theory and important previous studies. The goal is to supply sufficient background for readers to understand and evaluate the experiment and its results without having to read previous publications.


% Methods and Procedures
% Description of system under test (what is being tested)
% Description of test setup (what are you testing the SUT with)
% Description of Test procedures (How is the test performed) 
% Description of individual tests (e.g. Test Matrix)
\section{Methods and Procedures}
%This section describes and demonstrates in detail the Methods, Results, and Discussion generated by the report
The methods section should include a description of the apparatus or equipment used (e.g. the test or experimental setup), a description of the system under test (SUT), and a description of the process or procedures (e.g. what tests are to be performed typically represented in a test matrix and how the tests are to be done) to be followed in chronological order to meet validation/verification requirements of a SUT.  This section should include enough detail so that another researcher could duplicate the experiment (tables, graphs, diagrams, pictures, measurement outputs in appropriate formats, spreadsheets, test matrices should be included). Also include any calculations used to conduct the experiment.

% Laboratory experimental results
\section{Laboratory Experimental Results}
The experimental results are the data and information yielded during the experiment. Although experimental results should be clearly stated in verbal form, also include and refer to tables, charts, graphs, pictures, or calculations that further strengthen your findings. Remember to number, label and call out each of your table, charts, pictures, graphs or other form of representative information in your verbal discussions! A clear statement drawing attention to the experimental results will help readers interpret any figures, tables or graphs. Do not include all of your raw data in this section. Extract important data items and place the remaining data items in an appendix. Remember to reference any appendices as necessary. State results in clear language and in past tense. 

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
The discussion presents an interpretation of the data and \underline{\textbf{is the most important part}}, demonstrating the experimenter(s) understanding of the experiment and related concepts. The purpose of the discussion section is to explain, analyze, and interpret experimental findings. The significance or meaning of the experimental results should be communicated. Focus this section as appropriate by: comparing expected results with actual results, analyzing experimental error, explaining results in terms of theoretical issues, relating results to the experimental objectives, comparing results to similar investigations, and analyzing the strengths and limitation of the experimental design. Tip: Summarize the experimental steps or tests in an experimental or test matrix and document the degree to which the experiment achieved/failed its goals.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
This section presents overall conclusions relating to the original purpose of the laboratory.  List conclusions in order of importance and link them to information in previous sections of the report. The conclusion should include a statement of what is known “for sure.” 

% Recommendations
\section{Recommendations}
This section is for any recommendations, including how to improve performance if redesigning the product.  State what actions should be taken based on the results of the study. As well as anything that could be done better in the lab.

% Laboratory reflection
\section{Laboratory reflection}
This section differs from the conclusions and recommendations since it is focused on your (or your teams) performance in the design process. You should ask yourself; what did I do well? What did I do poorly? How can I improve upon this performance? What are your specific plans for the next design step? How will you achieve success in this upcoming design step? 


% References 
\section{References}
Appropriately document any textual research, fieldwork, and primary sources (interviews, observations, surveys). Use IEEE journal reference formats [5].

% Appendices
\section{Appendices}
The appendices include any data, calculations, graphs, pictures, or tables that were not included in the report. Each item should be contained in a separate appendix. Remember, if an appendix is included, it must be referenced in the report at least once.
