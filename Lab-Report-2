\tab The Abstract should be indented an additional half an inch on both sides of the paragraph from the margins, and should be at the top of the first page after the table on contents, and before the introduction. 

The abstract is typically one paragraph (200- words) that summarizes the purpose of the report, the methods employed, the key findings, and the significance or major conclusions. This section should include concise statements and contain specific information.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The introduction should include the purpose (what was tested), problem (why was the experiment conducted), and scope (what was analyzed) of the report. In addition, introductions can sometimes include justification of the experiment’s importance. It can also refer to relevant theory and important previous studies. The goal is to supply sufficient background for readers to understand and evaluate the experiment and its results without having to read previous publications.


\textbf{System 1 under test:} \\
The first system under test was constructed in order to verify that the float switch worked correctly. There will be one float switch that will monitor the water level in the water chamber. Since it is a switch, when the water in the chamber is at or above it, full contact is made. When the water falls below it, however, the switch will no longer be closed and the circuit will be open. As a result, no current will flow and the micro-controller will be notified and respond by disabling the water pump. In order to ensure that the float switch functioned properly, the following test was constructed and executed. \\

\noindent{\textbf{System 1 Test Setup:} 
The float switch was tested using the following components:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Float Switch (RSF83Y)
\item 5 V power supply (from Arduino Uno R3 micro-controller)
\item LED (light emitting diode)
\item 2k Ohm Resistor
\item 4 Wires
\end{itemize}
\textbf{System 1 Test Procedure:}
The test was performed by first connecting each of the two copper wires from the float switch to two separate wires. This was done because the copper wires could not fit into the bread board on their own. Next, 5 volts was supplied from the Arduino Uno and connected to one of the wires from the float switch. Then, the other wire from the float switch was connected to a 2k Ohm resistor. The resistor was then connected to the positive terminal of the LED and the negative terminal was connected to ground. Once the circuit was completed, the float switch was closed and the LED lit up. Next the LED was closed and the LED turned off. \\
\\
\textbf{System 2 Under Test:} The second system under test was constructed in order confirm that the photoresistor worked properly. The photoresistor will be used to monitor the amount of sunlight inside of the green house. When light is present, the resistor has a lower resistance and as the light decreases, the resistance increases. The the voltage will change as a result of the resistance increasing or decreasing  due to Ohms's Law and the micro-controller will monitor these changes and enable LEDS when there isn't enough sunlight present. The following test was orchestrated in order to ensure that the photoresistor was functioning properly. (See appendix for pictures of the test conducted)\\


\noindent{\textbf{System 2 Test Setup: }} The photoresistor was tested using the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item Photoresistor
\item 5 V power supply (from Arduino Uno R3 micro-controller)
\item LED(light emitting diode)
\item 2 Wires
\end{itemize}

\textbf{System 2 Test Procedure:} The test was performed by first connecting 5 volts from the Arduino Uno to the photoresistor. Next, the photoresistor was connected to the positive terminal of the LED. The negative terminal of the LED was then connected to ground. Once the circuit was completed, a finger was used to cover the top of the photoresistor. When this happened, the LED dimmed because the resistance increased. Next the photoresitor was uncovered and the birghtness of the LED increased. (See appendix for pictures of the test conducted)
\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:} \\
This next testing session tests the reliability and integrity of the supplied humidity and temperature sensor. The given sensor, or the DHT22, has the ability to detect the percentage of humidity and the temperature of the air around it. This test is to ensure that the implementation created in the Arduino IDE works correctly and creates logically outputs. As well as to test the functionality of the device.\\

\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:}
The DHT22 was tested using the following components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT22)
    \item Arduino Uno R3 Micro-Controller
    \item 10k Ohm Resistor
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{System 3 Test Procedure:} \\
The DHT22 was thoroughly tested using a breadboard and an Arduino UNO R3 to provide 5 volts to in the VCC pin. The second PWM pin is connected to the data line of the DHT22. Ground is connected to ground. A pinout for the DHT22 can be found in the Appendix. Below is the a section of the code implementation for the testing.

This code loads the incoming humidity and temperature readings to two different variables, h and f. The code iterates this loop every 1 second for a reliable output of readings. The output monitor for this section can be found in the Laboratory Experimental Results.

% Laboratory experimental results
\section{Laboratory Experimental Results}
The experimental results are the data and information yielded during the experiment. Although experimental results should be clearly stated in verbal form, also include and refer to tables, charts, graphs, pictures, or calculations that further strengthen your findings. Remember to number, label and call out each of your table, charts, pictures, graphs or other form of representative information in your verbal discussions! A clear statement drawing attention to the experimental results will help readers interpret any figures, tables or graphs. Do not include all of your raw data in this section. Extract important data items and place the remaining data items in an appendix. Remember to reference any appendices as necessary. State results in clear language and in past tense. 

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
The discussion presents an interpretation of the data and \underline{\textbf{is the most important part}}, demonstrating the experimenter(s) understanding of the experiment and related concepts. The purpose of the discussion section is to explain, analyze, and interpret experimental findings. The significance or meaning of the experimental results should be communicated. Focus this section as appropriate by: comparing expected results with actual results, analyzing experimental error, explaining results in terms of theoretical issues, relating results to the experimental objectives, comparing results to similar investigations, and analyzing the strengths and limitation of the experimental design. Tip: Summarize the experimental steps or tests in an experimental or test matrix and document the degree to which the experiment achieved/failed its goals.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
This section presents overall conclusions relating to the original purpose of the laboratory.  List conclusions in order of importance and link them to information in previous sections of the report. The conclusion should include a statement of what is known “for sure.” 

% Recommendations
\section{Recommendations}
This section is for any recommendations, including how to improve performance if redesigning the product.  State what actions should be taken based on the results of the study. As well as anything that could be done better in the lab.

% Laboratory reflection
\section{Laboratory reflection}
This section differs from the conclusions and recommendations since it is focused on your (or your teams) performance in the design process. You should ask yourself; what did I do well? What did I do poorly? How can I improve upon this performance? What are your specific plans for the next design step? How will you achieve success in this upcoming design step? 


% References 
\section{References}
Appropriately document any textual research, fieldwork, and primary sources (interviews, observations, surveys). Use IEEE journal reference formats [5].

% Appendices
\section{Appendices}
The appendices include any data, calculations, graphs, pictures, or tables that were not included in the report. Each item should be contained in a separate appendix. Remember, if an appendix is included, it must be referenced in the report at least once.
