% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
 Three different systems were designed for the purpose of prototyping: an irrigation system, a temperature and humidity sensing system with heating and cooling, and a light sensing system. The irrigation system makes use of a pump, a water source with a switch float, and a soil moisture sensor. After repeated testing of the pump, it was seen that at least 12 volts is needed to drive it's motor and successfully take in and put out water. The pump is intertwined with the float switch and the soil moisture sensor, as it is only activated when the switch is closed, indicating that there is a sufficient amount of water in the source, and when the sensor indicates that moisture is low in the soil. A test plan was made for this system, and its outcome can be seen in the Experimental Results section of the report. The temperature and humidity sensing system with heating and cooling makes use of the DHT22, a fan, and a heater. When the program for the product is run, a serial monitor displays all temperature and relative humidity in the room, updating every two seconds. When the temperature rises above 82 degrees Fahrenheit or the humidity gets above 50 percent, a fan is activated, along with a red LED being turned on. When the temperature falls below 82 degrees Fahrenheit or the humidity falls below 50 percent, a blue LED is turned on and the heater is activated. A test plan with its outcome can again be found in the Experimental Results section. The final prototyping portion of the product is the light sensing system. A circuit was created with the photoresistor, an LED, and transistor. When the resistance in the photoresistor is less than 4 mega ohms, the LED is turned off. When the resistance in the photoresistor reaches above 43 mega ohms, the LED is turned on. This final test plan with its results can be seen in the Experimental Results section. 
%Methods
\section{Methods and Procedures}
\textbf{System 1 Under Test:} \\
This first system tests the usage of the DHT22. This small sensor easily outputs precise readings for the ambient temperature and humidity. Below is a small section of the Arduino code that controls this sensor. This code snippet stores the temperature and humidity readings from the DHT22 into variables f and h respectively.\\

    \begin{figure} [h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[height = 30, width = 200]{Inputs.png}
        \caption{Code to set variables h and f to the humidity and temperature}
    \end{figure} \\
    
\indent The main point of this system is to successfully control an LED, Blow Dryer, and Fan using the sensor. Since the final prototype will need to control a red LED to show the user that the greenhouse is too hot or humid. The prototype will also need to start a fan if the greenhouse becomes too hot and a blow dryer if the greenhouse becomes too cold. \\

\noindent{\textbf{System 1 Test Setup:}
The system was built using these components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item DHT22
    \item Arduino Micro-controller
    \item RGB LED
    \item Fan
    \item Blow Dryer
    \item 3x 220 Ohm Resistors
    \item 10k Ohm Resistor
\end{itemize} \\

\noindent\textbf{System 1 Test Procedure:} \\
This next image shows the wiring diagram for this system.\\

    \begin{figure} [h!]

        \includegraphics[height = 150, width = 350]{System-1.png}
        \caption{Wiring diagram for system 1}
    \end{figure} \\
    
\indent As seen, the data output from the DHT22 goes into Pin 2 on the Arduino. This data is read as the inputs f and h for temperature and humidity. Depending on the resulting inputs, the Arduino will drive the several pins connected to the RGB LED high. Although, these pins have the ability to output specific voltages from the user. This can grant the user access to millions of different color combinations to choose from. For now, the code will only output a HIGH or LOW signal to the pins.\\
\indent This wiring diagram also shows a fan and a blow dryer that are attached to the Arduino. This fan is activated whenever the temperature readings become higher than 75 degrees. The blow dryer is activated whenever the temperature becomes lower than 55 degrees.\\

    \end{figure} \\
    
\indent Above is the serial monitor outputs for this system. This monitor shows the exact values that the DHT22 is producing. This eases the debugging of the system significantly, as the students can check to see if the code is working in response to different humidity and temperatures.\\

\noindent\textbf{System 2 Under Test:}\\
The second system under test was constructed in order create a circuit that would turn on the LED when the photoresistor resistor reaches 45 Mega-Ohms. The photoresistor will be used to monitor the amount of sunlight inside of the green house. When light is present, the resistor has a lower resistance, about 3 Mega-Ohms, and as the light decreases, the resistance increases to about 45 Mega-Ohms. The the voltage will change as a result of the resistance increasing or decreasing  due to Ohms's Law and the micro-controller will monitor these changes and enable LEDS when there isn't enough sunlight present. The following test was orchestrated in order to ensure that the LED turned on when there wasn't enough light present. (See appendix for pictures of the test conducted)\\

\noindent{\textbf{System 2 Test Setup: }} The photoresistor was tested using the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Photoresistor
    \item 5 V power supply (from Arduino Uno R3 micro-controller)
    \item LED (light emitting diode)
    \item 2 Wires
    \item 10k Ohm resistor
    \item NPN Transistor (PN2222)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{System 2 Test Procedure:}\\
The test was performed by first connecting 5 volts from the Arduino Uno to the 10k Ohm resistor. Next, the 10k Ohm resistor was connected to the collector and to the base of the transistor.  The photoresistor was also connected to the base of the transistor and to the negative terminal of the LED. The positive terminal of the LED was connected to the emitter and the 5 volt source, the photresistor and the LED were all grounded. \\

\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:} \\
This next testing session tests the reliability and integrity of the supplied humidity and temperature sensor. The given sensor, or the DHT22, has the ability to detect the percentage of humidity and the temperature of the air around it. This test is to ensure that the implementation created in the Arduino IDE works correctly and creates logically outputs. As well as to test the functionality of the device.\\

\noindent{\textbf{System 3 Test Setup:}
The DHT22 was tested using the following components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT22)
    \item Arduino Uno R3 Micro-Controller
    \item 10k Ohm Resistor
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{System 3 Test Procedure:} \\
The DHT22 was thoroughly tested using a breadboard and an Arduino UNO R3 to provide 5 volts to in the VCC pin. The second PWM pin is connected to the data line of the DHT22. Ground is connected to ground. A pinout for the DHT22 can be found in the Appendix. Below is the a section of the code implementation for the testing. 


This code loads the incoming humidity and temperature readings to two different variables, h and f. The code iterates this loop every 1 second for a reliable output of readings. The output monitor for this section can be found in the Laboratory Experimental Results.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}Thus far in the lab, three out of the four sensors/switches for the product have been tested, including the light sensor, the float switch, and the DHT22. All components ended with the same result of functioning correctly, with no issues arising. The photoresistor was tested by connecting it to a 5-volt source and an LED. When the photoresistor was covered, the LED became dimmer, while when it was left uncovered in light, the LED shined with much more brightness. It was concluded that the photoresistor becomes more resistant the darker it is in the room, and less resistant the lighter it is. The change in voltage due to the change in resistance will be captured by the micro-controller, and implemented to either turn the LED strip on the greenhouse ceiling on or off depending on the light capacity present. The DHT22 was tested by connecting its pins to the micro-controller and running a program provided by the Arduino library. The output was a box displaying the current humidity and temperature, which was refreshed every second to stay updated. When heat was applied to the sensor, the temperature successfully rose, and when an exhale of breath was applied, the humidity increased as well. This led to the conclusion that the sensor is working properly and will be implemented in the product to monitor the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse. When the temperature is too high or it is too humid, the micro-controller will sense this, and activate the fan. When it is too cold, the micro-controller will activate the heating system. The last component tested was the float switch. This test consisted of the switch being connected to a circuit that contains a resistor, a 5-volt source, and an LED. When the switch was closed, power could surge through the circuit and the LED was lit. When the switch was open, however, the circuit became open as well and no power could reach the LED. This is useful to the product, as when the water level becomes to low in the chamber, the switch will be opened and the micro-controller will receive this input. The micro-controller will then disable usage of the pump, as to not waste any power when there is no water to deliver. It will also light up an LED to indicate to the user that the chamber does not enough water and needs to be refilled. The remaining component, the soil moisture sensor, will be tested using the following plan: two pots will be set up, one with dry soil and one with wet soil. Each pot will receive a sensor, and the voltage return from each of these sensors will be viewed on the oscilloscope to obtain an accurate reading. When the micro-controller obtains a voltage correlating to dry soil, it will activate the pump to deliver water to the pot containing this soil, to ensure that all plants maintain a sufficient amount of water to maintain proper development. 

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
The purpose of this prototyping and testing stage are to gather the components needed to start creating a working model that will perform as intended. Through this lab and the device testing throughout, the students have gathered enough information to prove that each device is working and performs in a nominal fashion. Overall, the humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22), the photoresistor, and the the float switch (RSF38Y) work correctly. The soil moisture sensor will be tested for functionality in the very near future.

% Laboratory reflection
\section{Laboratory reflection}
Although to us, each of these device seemed complex, (especially the ones we have never seen or used before), implementation was rather simple once we searched through each of the data sheets. Unfortunately, we were not able to conduct testing on the VH400 Soil Moisture Sensor, but we plan to in the near future. Once that is done we will then begin implementing each of the devices together and get a working system created. The main aspect in this lab report that slumped our performance was our time management. We should have sectioned off when each of the components should have been testing and should have had a better schedule overall.

We have plans to purchase an LED strip that is compatible with Arduino to use for lighting the plants during the dark, rather than using a small LED bulb. We also plan to go out and buy soil, pots, and plants to use in testing the VH400.
